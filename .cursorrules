# Cursor Rules for ESLatin CSMS Project

## Documentation Policy

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT create or generate Markdown (.md) documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

### Rules:
1. **No automatic documentation generation**: Do not create README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or any other .md files unless the user explicitly asks for them.
2. **Code comments are preferred**: Use code comments and docstrings instead of separate documentation files.
3. **Wait for user request**: Only generate documentation when the user explicitly requests it, typically after the service/feature is complete.
4. **Documentation location**: If documentation is needed, it should be placed in the `docs/` directory, not in service directories (app/, admin/, charger-sim/, csms/).
5. **All existing .md files have been moved to docs/**: Do not create new .md files in service directories. All documentation should be in `docs/` directory.

### Service Directories:
- `app/` - Mobile application (React Native/Expo)
- `admin/` - Admin management platform (Next.js)
- `charger-sim/` - Charger simulator
- `csms/` - CSMS backend service

### Documentation Structure:
All documentation is organized in `docs/` directory:
- `docs/modules/` - Module-specific documentation
- `docs/deployment/` - Deployment guides
- `docs/development/` - Development guides
- `docs/architecture/` - Architecture documentation
- `docs/validation/` - Testing and validation
- `docs/troubleshooting/` - Troubleshooting guides

### Code Style:
- Focus on writing clean, well-commented code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add inline comments where necessary
- Use docstrings for functions and classes
- Avoid creating separate documentation files during development
